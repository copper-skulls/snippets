# FR BIO CODES

Free to use/modify on the `flightrising.com` website without credit, however you want, **except** removing already present credit lines for the resources used, if you still use them.

If you wish to credit me, you can either link this repo or just mention Lupik (#277), but this is fully optional.

The image used to stretch the left column is by Stormlord (#139), if you wish to switch it out, their thread is [here](https://www1.flightrising.com/forums/cc/2863041#post_43362535)!

The little soundbars are made by me. You can find speed/colour variants [here](https://airship-full-of-dragons.tumblr.com/post/647881699155443712/lmao-the-middle-brown-one-doesnt-seem-to-work-on).

Buttons are/icons by Serpenta, thread with more is [here](https://www1.flightrising.com/forums/cc/1985777#post_1985777), or they can be swapped for any on-site item with FR's item code and will still look nice :)
