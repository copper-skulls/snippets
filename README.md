# snippets
Code snippets that don't fit anywhere else. Often html/css/bbc code. Unless stated otherwise in a corresponding `README.md`, free to use without credit for whatever. These things are tiny.

For more information and usage instructions, see `README.md`s in the respective sub-folders.

**Currently contains:**
- [CSS](./css/)
  - small css snippets
  - [`tumblr_old_footer.css`](./css/tumblr_old_footer.css): changes the new (as of 20/01/2022) tumblr footer to something very closely resembling the old one instead. compact. Maintained, but consider looking into Xkit Rewritten, which also fixes this the Tweaks extension!
  - [`deviantart_stats_begone.css`](./css/deviantart_stats_begone.css): hides the stats line on: deviations, profiles, and hides favourite and comment counts from thumbnails.
- [FR Bio codes](./fr_bio_codes/README.md)
